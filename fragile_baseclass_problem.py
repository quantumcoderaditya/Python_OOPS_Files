# Fragile base class problem is a software issue that arises in OOPS when changes made to the base class can break the functionality of the derived class. This problem occurs due to tight coupling between base and derived classes in inheritance hierarchies.

# Key points about the Fragile Base Class Problem:

# 1.  Inheritance Coupling - An inheritance creates a strong coupling between base class or super classes and the derived classes or the subclasses, becuase any change made to the base class  can potentially affect the behavior of all derived classes and effectively it could break our program. 

# 2.  Ripple Effect - So modifying the implementation details or adding new bheavior or changing the behavior of base class can have a ripple affect on all derived classes. And this could lead to unintended consequences and require extensive testing or regression testing which is testing to ensure that the new code changes doesnt affect the functionality of the software. 

# 3.  Limited Extensibility - It can limit the extensibility of the software systems because modifications to the base class can become extremely risky and costly over time and developers could avoid making changes in fear of breaking existing functionality. 

# 4.  Brittle Software - Fragie Base problem contributes to the brittleness of the software systems, where seemingly minor changes to one part of the code base have unexpected failures in other areas. 

# 5.  Mitigation Strategies- Using Solid principles

# Thus we can say that Fragile Base Class Problem highlights the changes associated with maintaining inheritance hierarchies in Object Oriented Software Programming. It also underscores the importance of designing softwares with extensability and maintainability in mind. While also considering alternate approaches to inheritance when appropriate.
